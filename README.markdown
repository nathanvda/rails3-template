# Rails3-template

This is a template, for use with rails3, that includes

- jquery and jquery-ui
- rspec2, factory-girl and cucumber
- haml
- simplecov (for ruby 1.9.2)

To use this template, create a new rails project as follows:

    rails new your-new-name --template=/path/to/this/template

i wonder, but it would be nice if something like

    rails new you-other-new-name --template=http://github.com/nathanvda/rails3-template.git

would work?
